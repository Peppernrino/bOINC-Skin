# bOINC-Skin
An even smaller skin for the BOINC application. A continuation of my work on the branded skin found here: https://github.com/gridcoin-community/BOINC_Skin

I am attempting to make the file size as small as possible. I have made some of the images transparent, and this makes the background pink in Simple View. This is fine for me as the goal is to make the skin as tiny and "performant" as possible.

We are down to 6.24 KB (6,393 bytes) and only a few errors, some of which seem like application faults.

Remaining Skin errors from stderrgui.txt
